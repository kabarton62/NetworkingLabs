**eth_switch labs:**

eth_switch labs use Linux bridges to simulate basic switch function. Frames are forwarded between hosts using TCP/IP Layer 2 functions in Linux bridges. These labs connect hosts to isolated bridges, simulating stand-alone Ethernet switches. Hosts connected to a single switch are capable of communicating, but hosts cannot communicate with hosts connected to other switches.
