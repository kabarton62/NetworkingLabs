## Practice
The main goal of Lab1_practice is to examine network traffic in a switched network, but Lab1_practice also introduces Linux Bridges, Containerlabs, and the operation of Docker instances. The lab captures network traffic in a very simple switched Ethernet network. The topology does not include routers or the ability to *route* network traffic.
## Discovery
The Lab2_discovery introduces a new challenge. You are provided an executable binary file that will deploy a new network topology. Because that topology file is binary, you will not be able to examine the topology directly through the configuration file. Instead, the network topology will have to be discovered by testing connections and examining network packet captures.
