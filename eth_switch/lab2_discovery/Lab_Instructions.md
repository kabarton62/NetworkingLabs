## Discovering & Illustrating Network Topology in an Ethernet Switched Network
### Challenge 1: Deploy the Network
1. Clone the repository https://github.com/kabarton62/NetworkingLabs.git
2. Change directory to NetworkingLabs/eth_switch/lab2_discovery/
3. RUn deploy.sh
```
bash deploy.sh
```
---

### Challenge 2: Network Discovery
Use containerlab feedback and utilities such as brctl, ifconfig, ip a, and ping to discover hosts and configuration. Note that a shell can be opened in any of the hosts created by deploy.sh using SSH. **The username and password for every host created in deploy.sh is admin/admin**.

### Challenge 3: Illustrate Network Topology
Create a network diagram that accurately and completely illustrates the network topology. Node, network devices, links, and IP addresses must be explicitly reported in the network diagram.

### Challenge 4: Destroy the Network
Use destroy.sh to destroy the network. Not sure how to destroy the network with destroy.sh? Adapt information from Challenge 1 to complete this challenge.
