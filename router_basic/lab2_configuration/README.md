## Configuring Vyos Interfaces
### Network Diagramming
You are provided a table that summarizes the links betweens nodes in the network. You are tasked with creating a network diagram from the information provided.

### Subnetting
In this lab, you are not provided with the specific IP addresses to configure the router interfaces. Instead, you given subnets or required to discover subnets from host configurations. You will calculate the IP address to needed to configure each router interface from those subnets.

### Lab Instructions
The overall goal of this lab is to use the skills developed in Lab 1 Practice to configure router interfaces, configure static IP routes, and test network operation. You will also create a network diagram from summarized network information and calcualte IP ranges from IP addresses and subnet masks. 

Detailed lab instructions are in [Lab_Instructions.md](Lab_Instructions.md).

Lab submission requirements are in [Lab_Submission.md](Lab_Submission.md)
