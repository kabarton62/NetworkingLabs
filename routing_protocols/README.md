## Routing Protocol Practice
This lab includes three networks (North, Central and South). Router and host interfaces are configured with the correct IP addresses and subnet masks, but the routers do not have routes configured or known, other than Kernel and directly connected routes. As a result, communications between nodes are very limited. Introducing routing protocols will enable the routers to dynamically learn routes and enable full communications between all nodes.

Users will configure routing protocols and demonstrate successful communication between all nodes in the North, Central and South networks.

## Routing Protocol Configuration
Lab 2 Configuration builds upon the skills practiced in Lab 1 Practice. Given a basic network topology and a network with hosts, routers, switches and connections, the lab challenges the user to configure the routers to enable all hosts to communicate. 

## Vyos Documentation
These labs use Vyos router Docker containers. A Vyos User Guide can be found [here](https://docs.vyos.io/en/latest/configuration/index.html). Basic commands needed for these labs are included in the practice lab instructions but refer to Vyos documentation for additional assistance.
