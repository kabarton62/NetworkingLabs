## Networking Services Practice
Lab 1 Practice includes routers, LANs and two DNS servers. Nodes in the LANs are preconfigured to request DHCP configuration. Routers include interface and routing protocol configurations. Users will configure NAT, DHCP and DNS services.

## Routing Protocol Configuration
Lab 2 Configuration builds upon the skills practiced in Lab 1 Practice. Given a basic network topology and a network with LANS, hosts, routers, DNS servers, the lab challenges the user to configure NAT, DHCP and DNS services. 

## Vyos Documentation
These labs use Vyos router Docker containers. A Vyos User Guide can be found [here](https://docs.vyos.io/en/latest/configuration/index.html). Basic commands needed for these labs are included in the practice lab instructions but refer to Vyos documentation for additional assistance.
