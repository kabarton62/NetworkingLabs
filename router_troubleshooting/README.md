## Router Troubleshooting Practice
This lab includes a network with router configuration errors. Router and host interfaces are configured with the correct IP addresses and subnet masks, but the routers do not have routes configured or known, other than Kernel and directly connected routes.

Users will troubleshoot, isolate and correct router configuration errors, then demonstrate successful communication between all nodes in the network.

## Router Troubleshooting
Lab 2 Troubleshooting builds upon the skills practiced in Lab 1 Practice. Given a basic network topology and a network with hosts, routers, switches and connections, the lab challenges the user to troubleshoot and resolve router configuration errors to enable all hosts to communicate. 

## Vyos Documentation
These labs use Vyos router Docker containers. A Vyos User Guide can be found [here](https://docs.vyos.io/en/latest/configuration/index.html). Basic commands needed for these labs are included in the practice lab instructions but refer to Vyos documentation for additional assistance.
